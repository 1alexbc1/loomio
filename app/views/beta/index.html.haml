%p Being a beta release, there will be a few bugs, and some things are still changing. This is not ready for general usage like a 2.0 final release will be.

%p That said, there is a whole lot of exciting new features and benefits, and we believe many people will be comfortable using 2.0 beta as their main Loomio version.
